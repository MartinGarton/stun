stun
====

A go library for STUN protocol that provides both client and server implementations

It is still in its infancy and only provides a very basic client. To install the client run the following command:

go get github.com/ctulek/stun/stun-client

If you just need the library, import as "github.com/ctulek/stun". See the stun.Call function for how to make a STUN client request.
